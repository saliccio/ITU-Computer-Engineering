First of all, if you are not familiar with Python and Jupyter Notebook, find and download the "LFD_ML_Guidelines.pdf" under the Class Files in Ninova. You will find some resources to learn about anything you'll need for this and upcoming homeworks.

All the instructions about the homework is given in HW1.ipynb file. For those of you who are not familiar with this type of files, it is a python notebook document, used mostly by Jupyter Notebook. In it, you can code python in cells, while you can also insert formatted texts and visualizations. To install Jupyter, after installing Python, run the following commands on your command window:

 - For Python 2.7:
             > pip install --upgrade pip
             > pip install notebook
 - For Python 3.3+:
             > pip3 install --upgrade pip
             > pip3 install notebook

For this homework and the rest of the course, we highly advise you to use Python 3.

After installing jupyter notebook you can launch it by typing following command on command line:
             
             > jupyter notebook

Refer to the tutorials in "LFD_ML_Guidelines.pdf" to learn more about Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, after installing jupyter, you can also examine the tutorial notebook "JupyterNotebook_SmallIntroduction.ipynb", prepared by Res. Asst. Şeymanur Aktı, under class files. It is a very brief introduction to the jupyter.

For this homework, you are not going to create any additional code or report files. You are going to add all your work in the HW1.ipynb file. Necessary instructions are given in the notebook.

For this homework, you are going to need the following libraries:

-numpy==1.21.5
-matplotlib==3.1.3
-pandas==1.0.1
-sklearn==0.22.1

The numbers after the '==' refers to the version. These versions work, however it probably works for the newer versions and some of the older versions as well. These versions are the ones we used to create the homework, and we suggest that you use these versions for compatibility while checking your homeworks, but if you'd like, you can try other versions as well.
