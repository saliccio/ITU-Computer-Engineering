    "# Part 1: Simple Linear Regression  (30 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember from the course material: In Linear Regression, we aim to find the line that fits the given data as well as possible. The line formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### <center> $ \\hat{y} = f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x $ <center> \n",
    "\n",
    "And using linear regression, the goal is to find the $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ such that the the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is minimized:\n",
    "    \n",
    "### <center> $ MSE \\Rightarrow \\mathcal{L} = \\dfrac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - f(x_i ))^2 $ <center> \n",
    "    \n",
    "As the MSE error gets smaller, the line starts to represent the data better and better.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Consider $\\beta = (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1)$. In order to find the $\\beta$ that minimizes the MSE loss, we use **Gradient Descent**. Iteratively $\\beta$ is updated in the opposite direction of the gradient, while the size of the update is controlled with the learning rate $\\eta$:\n",
    "    \n",
    "### <center> $ \\beta \\leftarrow \\beta-\\eta \\frac{d \\mathcal{L}}{d \\beta} $ <center> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you are going to code up Simple Linear Regression on the data given in **data1.csv**, and find the line that fits the data best. To do so, you'll need to complete the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code up the gradient descent, and print the loss value at every time step. You can use the number of steps as the stopping criteria (e.g. stopping gradient descent after 10 steps). \n",
    "- At the end of the algorithm, plot the found line with the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Given learning rate and number of iterations as default values in the code should work, but you are free to change them to make your algorithm faster if you'd like. You are not allowed to use any libraries other than the imported ones at the beginning. You can initialize the $\\beta$ randomly."

    "\n",
    "In this part, you are going to train a Multi Linear Regression Model on a real dataset! The dataset we are going to use is **California House Pricing Dataset**. The target is to predict the median house value in California, given the 8 features ( You can examine the name of the features when you run the load_data function given below ). In this part, you will also use Cross-Validation with 5 folds, in addition to everything you implemented in Part 1. You will also alter your code so that it works with multiple attribute. In this case, you will have 8 features and you can code up assuming you will always have 8 features. At the end, you will report your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, you will need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code up gradient descent with Cross Validation for Multi Linear Regression\n",
    "- Find the best working learning rate and number of iterations setup.\n",
    "- Report the MSE loss periodically during training in folds (For example, if you are training for 1000 steps, you can print MSE loss for each 100 steps. If you are training for 100000 steps ( which you can, if you'd like ), you can print MSE loss for each 10000 steps. In total, if you print the loss 10 times periodically for each fold, it's fine ).\n",
    "- Save the final MSE results on the testing set on each fold in an array. Print the average testing MSE losses at the end of the algorithm. Additionally, print the variance of the testing MSE losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we are giving you only the load_data function, so you are flying solo for Multi Linear Regression! It is up to you to find the working learning rate and number of iterations setup. In addition to the libraries imported for Part 1, you are allowed to use sklearn for fetching dataset (which is already done for you), and the KFold class for the cross-validation. Other than that, you are not allowed to use sklearn or any other additional libraries.\n",
